# Broadcast Messages

![Broadcast Message List](./images/crm-broadcast-message-list.png)

## Overview

This module is used to send broadcast messages to all clients. These messages are sent using websockets for clients that are logged in. If they are not logged at the time of the message broadcast, they will be greeted with the message as a notification pop up when they sign in.

## Create a new broadcast message
